### Notes

The track appears to be in F♯ minor using only notes from the
Phrygian mode apart from one accidental in the melody in measure 10.

Only the main bass and melody parts are transcribed. The essentially
random flurry of notes in the bass part at the end of every eighth
measure is not transcribed. Pick random notes from the F♯ minor
Phrygian mode; noone will notice!

There is a quiet metallic-sounding guitar or harpsichord part that
plays underneath the main melody that is not yet transcribed. It
does not appear to apply any particular harmony and appears to
be there mainly to add texture to the piece.
